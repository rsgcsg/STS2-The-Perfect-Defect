# End-to-End Data Lifecycle

This is the operational contract from verified Platform evidence to a training-host input.
It does not authorize training or move gameplay authority into STPD.

## Authority And Artifact Classes

```text
STS2 + Platform Annotator
  -> immutable Human evidence and exact H/S/A/S' audit
  -> verified Platform bundle
  -> STPD ResearchTransition projection and B0
  -> immutable canonical corpus (CANONICAL_RESEARCH)
  -> versioned text/model view (DERIVED_MODEL_VIEW)
  -> optional frozen-Qwen features (DERIVED_FEATURE_CACHE)
  -> content-addressed training-input manifest
  -> training host verifies bytes + identities
  -> owner/scientific workflow separately authorizes optimizer creation
```

Platform evidence is the reconstruction authority for the Human witness. The canonical STPD
corpus is the research authority for splits, eligibility and model-neutral transitions. Text,
tokens and frozen features are disposable derived artifacts. Receipts, staging success and
cache hits never grant training authorization.

## Canonical Storage Decision

`ResearchTransition v0` remains the logical scientific API. Its physical representation is
canonical JSON fields in Zstd-compressed Parquet. The read-only profiler verifies manifest,
file checksum, row hashes and semantic dataset hash before measuring it:

```bash
uv run python tools/profile_data_lifecycle.py <canonical-dataset>
```

Candidate layouts are temporary and must reconstruct every logical record exactly. The
2026-08-29 experiment on the largest available admitted corpus (106 rows) found:

| Layout | Bytes | Relative to current |
|---|---:|---:|
| current canonical columns | 86,148 | 1.000 |
| dictionary on current columns | 87,077 | 1.011 |
| content-addressed state/catalog objects | 96,296 | 1.118 |
| monolithic canonical record JSON | 52,611 | 0.611 |

Object normalization and dictionary encoding were worse at this scale. Monolithic JSON is
smaller, but the gain does not yet justify losing typed scanning, and the frozen 1,962-row
corpus is not physically present on this Mac. No canonical migration is authorized. Reopen
only with a representative immutable corpus, exact reconstruction, read/scan benchmarks and
a material end-to-end win.

## Frozen Feature Artifact

`tools/compile_joint_features.py` compiles Scheme 1 pooled joint features with the exact
frozen `RealQwenBackend`. Its immutable manifest binds source corpus, serializer/input
profile, Qwen/tokenizer/weights identity, compiler operation, shape and every file checksum.

Identical state/action/model-view inputs share one feature row. `samples.parquet` retains
transition, candidate ordering and chosen labels; `features.npy` is memory-mappable. Any
source, serializer, profile, Qwen or compiler change creates a new artifact. The cache can
always be deleted and rebuilt.

The deterministic shape probe for the 106-row corpus produced 572 samples at hidden size
1,024 in 2,432,912 artifact bytes. Extrapolating only the dense tensor to the documented
11,348 candidate samples yields 46,481,408 bytes (44.33 MiB). This is storage engineering
evidence, not measured Qwen throughput; this Mac lacks the full exact weights and an admitted
CUDA training host.

## Training-Host Handoff

Build, stage and verify are separate operations:

```bash
uv run python tools/compile_joint_features.py \
  --dataset <canonical-dataset> \
  --output-root <derived-cache> \
  --qwen-snapshot <verified-qwen-snapshot>

uv run python tools/training_input.py build \
  --dataset <canonical-dataset> \
  --store <source-store> \
  --lane scheme1-pooled-joint \
  --serializer stpd-model-serialization-v1 \
  --input-profile stpd-combat-v0-standard \
  --qwen-identity <qwen-identity.json> \
  --feature-artifact <derived-cache>/joint-features-... \
  --consumer-entry-point "uv run python tools/s1_smoke.py run"

uv run python tools/training_input.py stage \
  --source-store <source-store> \
  --receiver-store <training-host-store> \
  --training-input-id <sha256>

uv run python tools/training_input.py verify \
  --store <training-host-store> \
  --training-input-id <sha256>
```

Build refuses a dirty STPD worktree and binds the exact commit, `uv.lock` checksum and
consumer entry point. The receiver transfers only absent SHA-256 objects, verifies nested
feature/source/model-view bindings and writes a receipt. A new corpus or artifact creates a
new manifest while unchanged objects are reused.

The host receives canonical manifest/Parquet and only declared model-view or feature objects.
It does not receive raw Human sessions, game files, hidden state, unrelated caches, weights
from Git, an implicit "latest" dataset, or authorization to train.

## Invalidation And Retention

| Change | Canonical corpus | Text/token view | Pooled features | Training input |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| new admitted evidence | new corpus | rebuild | rebuild | new manifest; old objects reused |
| split/B0/projection change | new corpus | rebuild | rebuild | new manifest |
| serializer/input profile | unchanged | rebuild | rebuild | new manifest |
| tokenizer/Qwen/feature operation | unchanged | affected view only | rebuild | new manifest |
| STPD source or `uv.lock` | unchanged | verify applicability | verify applicability | new consumer identity |
| transfer retry | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged | zero-byte reuse when complete |

Raw evidence and canonical research follow their owning retention policies. Derived features
and receiver stores are rebuildable caches. Model/checkpoint outputs are separate artifact
classes and never write back into canonical data.

## Evidence Boundary

Portable tests prove deterministic identity, tamper rejection, drift rejection, immutable
retry and exact reconstruction. The local experiment proves only the measured 106-row
layout. No remote transfer, full-corpus profile, real-Qwen compile, optimizer run,
model-quality improvement or training-host throughput is claimed.
